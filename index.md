# Welcome to the Web Based CV website

You can create multiple-themed websites using single config file.

Here is the list of themes which you can fork, modify and use. 
1. [Modern One Page CV](https://jmrchelani.github.io/web-based-cv/modern-one-pager) - Created by [Milton](https://github.com/jmrchelani)
2. [Simple One Page CV](https://jmrchelani.github.io/web-based-cv/simple-one-pager) - Created by [Kelash](https://github.com/KumarKelashMeghwar)

## How to edit this?

To edit the CV data, just change the `_config.yml` file and you are good to go.

This theme uses jekyll so you will need to configure that or use github pages for hosting.
